Known bugs in CMD version 0.0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o  let set work with or without the '=' sign.  People like it that way.
    (I don't know, if I should really fix this?)

o  command.com ignores control-c and control-break, which makes it difficult
   to quit typing a long file, among other things

o  "alias v = dir" doesn't work because of the spaces.
