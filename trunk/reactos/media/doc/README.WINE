# ReactOS WINE porting guide for 0.3
# Update this file when you port a dll/program from WINE.

The ReactOS Project shares quite a bit of code with the WINE project.
This document should provide a compleate reference for all of the
locations in the ReactOS source tree where code is shared between the
two projects. If you find something is missing from this documentation
please add it.

If you find that a function in ReactOS that is not implemented properly
and is based on WINE sources, check the latest Winehq CVS and see if
it has been fixed there. If so, please submit a patch to
ros-dev@reactos.org. Otherwise please send a patch to both
wine-patches@winehq.com and ros-dev@reactos.org

When porting a new DLL from Wine to ReactOS, please do the following steps
- Create a new directory in dll/win32/ of the same name as the new Wine DLL
- Add a new entry in dll/win32/win32.rbuild
- Follow the guide "Update process for autosync DLLs" at the bottom of this file

Update process for autosync DLLs

*** This process can only be done on Microsoft Windows ***
- Download wineimport.cmd at svn://svn.reactos.org/reactos/trunk/tools/
- Download cvs command line program and be sure to put it in your path
  (available at http://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/cvs/binary/stable/x86-woe/ )
- Download svn command line program and be sure to put it in your path
  (available at http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 )
- Download patch command line program and be sure to put it in your path
  (available at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm )
- Optionally, download junction.exe and put it in your path
  (available at http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Junction.html )
- Cd to the directory containing wineimport.cmd
- Run
  "wineimport.cmd fullprocessing {path_to_your_reactos_directory} {name_of_the_wine_dll}"
- In case of error, you can
  1) add missing definitions to ReactOS headers
  2) fix {name_of_the_wine_dll}_ros.diff patch file, by removing outdated changes
  3) or modify Wine code, by adding a {name_of_the_wine_dll}_ros.diff patch,
     which will be applied after Wine source checkout
     DO NOT DIRECTLY MODIFY WINE SOURCE CODE
- Once Wine DLL compiles, install and run ReactOS and search for regressions
- In case of regression, you can
  1) Fix ReactOS code (not in the shared DLL)
  2) or update the {name_of_the_wine_dll}_ros.diff patch file
- Commit your changes with the "Autosyncing with Wine HEAD" commit message
