1. What is ReactOS?
-------------------

ReactOS is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that is
compatible with Windows NT applications and drivers.

2. Relationship with the WINE project
-------------------------------------

ReactOS has always planned to work with the WINE project to share as much
programming effort as possible. This will mainly concern User Mode DLLs and
will happen once ReactOS's Kernel Mode areas are more complete, as those areas
form the underlying infrastructure. Other areas of cooperation lie in
applications and testing suites.


3. Future compatibility
-----------------------

The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows NT 4.0
compatibility, is always keeping an eye towards compatibility with future
Windows NT releases, that is, Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) and Windows XP (NT 5.1).


4. Supporting other System Applications
---------------------------------------

The Windows NT architecture allows for subsystems, as does the ReactOS
architecture. A subsystem is an implementation of the APIs of another
operating system, allowing ReactOS to run applications from other systems. We
are already looking at subsystems for: Java, OS/2 and DOS and possibly others
in the future.


5. Tutorials
