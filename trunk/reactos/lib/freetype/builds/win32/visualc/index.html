<h1>FreeType 2 Project Files for Visual C++</h1>

<p>This directory contains a project file for Visual C++, named
   <tt>freetype.dsp</tt>. It will compile the following libraries
   from the FreeType 2.1.4 sources:</p>

<ul>
  <pre>
    freetype214.lib     - release build; single threaded
    freetype214_D.lib   - debug build;   single threaded
    freetype214MT.lib   - release build; multi-threaded
    freetype214MT_D.lib - debug build;   multi-threaded
  </pre>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to extract the files with the Windows (CR+LF) line endings.
ZIP archives are already stored this way, so no further step is required.
If you use some .tar.*z archives, be sure to configure your extracting
tool to convert the line endings. For example, with
<a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a>, you should set the "TAR file
smart CR/LF Conversion" option on. Alternatively, you may consider using
the "unix2dos" or "u2d" utilities that are floating around, which
specifically deal with this particular problem.

<p>Build directories are placed in the top-level "objs" directory</p>

<p>Enjoy :-)</p>
