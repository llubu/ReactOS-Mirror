	* Re-organized the das directory.  Now the JavaScript disassembler
	is built automatically with the `all' target.  It is a
	`bin_SCRIPTS' target so it gets installed when the JavaScript
	package is installed.  The makefile also makes the `jsdasm' an
	executable and it sets the `js' interpreter command to the first
	line of the compiled `jsdasm' program.
