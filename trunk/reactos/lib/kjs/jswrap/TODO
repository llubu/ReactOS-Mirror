			     ===========

* Fix the debugging information in the embedded byte-code files: input
  file name (.psw) and line numbers.  This requires support from the
  compiler.

* The current version do not optimize with -O2.  We can't do the
  liveness analysing, because on `return' statements, arguments are
  not alive, and the by-reference return values won't work.  The
  compiler needs a new flag JSC$FLAG_OPTIMIZE_ARGUMENTS_LIVE_ON_RETURN
  that would fix the problem.
