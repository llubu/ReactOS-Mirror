* Design Goals

This implementation is not 100% compatible with the JavaScript
language, found from the Netscape's WWW browsers and servers.  To
achieve the following design goals, some shortcuts have been taken in
the implementation, as compared to the Netscape's implementation.

This implementation is designed to be:

- re-entrant

  the interpreter can be safely used in multi-threaded environments

- extendible

  the interpreter API allows user-defined commands and classes, and it
  allows reading and setting language's global variables

- fast

  the JavaScript code is compiled to byte-code that is executed by a
  virtual machine

- programmable

  it should be easy to implement large projects with the language


* WWW Home Page and Additional Information

The WWW home page of the NGS JavaScript interpreter is at URL:

	http://www.ngs.fi/js/

The home page contains up-to-date information about the interpreter,
its development, releases, documentation, etc.

Please note that the current version, js-0.2.0 is a work in progress.
It contains bugs and many features are still unimplemented.

Comments, suggestions, bug reports and fixes, feature wishes, etc. are
welcome.
