/*
    CompleteIO
        An APC called as a result of a call to CommitWaveHeaderToKernelDevice.

        and when the entire wave header has been dealt with, will call
        CompleteWaveHeader to have the wave header returned to the client.

    CommitWaveHeaderToKernelDevice
        Sends portions of the buffer described by the wave header to a kernel
        device. This must only be called from within the context of the sound
        thread. The caller supplies either their own commit routine, or uses
        WriteFileEx_Committer. The committer is called with portions of the
        buffer specified in the wave header.

    WriteFileEx_Committer
        Commit buffers using the WriteFileEx API.
