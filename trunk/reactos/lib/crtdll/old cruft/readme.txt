When merging msvcrt and crtdll into crt, mostly msvcrt stuff were used. All files in crtdll that was equal to files in msvcrt were deleted but those who were not are still here, possibly containing changes that we might want to merge into crt, thou its very likely that the changes are worthless. Someone should go thru it and either delete or merge sometime...
