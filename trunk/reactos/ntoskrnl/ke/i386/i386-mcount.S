/* We need a special version of the `mcount' function since for ix86 it
   must not clobber any register.  This has several reasons:
     - there is a bug in gcc as of version 2.7.2.2 which prohibits the
       use of profiling together with nested functions
     - the ELF `fixup' function uses GCC's regparm feature
     - some (future) systems might want to pass parameters in registers.  */
