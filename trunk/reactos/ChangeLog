9/6/99:        Implemented ZwOpenProcess
               Partially implemented killing other threads (possible memory
                                                            leaks)
	       Made a start on a proper implemention of APCs (based on 
	       article in NT insider)

8/12/98:       Corrected bug in shell (Read two keypresses and assumed they
               where the key going up and down respectively)
	       Corrected race in dpc handling
	       Took out cleanup sections in ZwReadFile (now handled by the APC)
	       Disabled broken code in kernel32
