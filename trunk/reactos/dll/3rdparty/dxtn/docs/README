This is a working codec for FXT1 and DXTn texture compression.
It has a balanced speed/quality ratio, and is very tweakable.

Both FXT1 and DXTn use vector quantization for lossy encoding.
The decoder is rather trivial, at the expense of the encoder
complexity. This means that applications heavily relying on
texture compression should provide precompressed textures, for
several obvious reasons:
1) the encoding phase can be done "off-line" with hi-quality
   encoders
2) if the graphic driver does not support precompressed textures,
   it's still cheap to decode "on-line" application-side
3) the distributed package gets smaller

The FXT1 and DXTn codecs were written using documentation freely
available on the world-wide-web, including, but not limited to:
3DFX_texture_compression_FXT1 and EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
from http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/
I just translated the human readable spec into ANSI C. There are
NO binaries available, as I am NOT using this code! Therefore,
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF USING THE CODE IS ENTIRELY WITH YOU!

The implementation per-se is made available under GPL, which
does not necessarily apply to the abstract content (texture
compression algorithms):
FXT1 is subject to "3DFX FXT1 Source Code General Public License"

DXTn is basically the S3TC texture compression, a license to the
     "S3TC Intellectual Property" may be required prior to any use.

     There is significant IP associated with the S3TC format.
     Existing users probably have executed licenses directly
     with S3 or its successors (Sonic Blue, S3 Graphics).

     The current ownership of the S3TC IP is unknown to me. It is
     known that when S3 exited the graphics hardware business, part of
     their operations were sold to ATI and part were spun off to a joint
     Taiwanese venture with Via Technologies, called S3 Graphics.

I, DANIEL BORCA, AM NOT AWARE OF ANY LEGAL ISSUE CAUSED BY RELEASING
THIS CODE. Prior to commencement of legal action, the Plaintiff should
make an informal demand to Cease and Desist. In deference to the
regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, which requires
notice prior to filing an action, and in the spirit of cooperation,
all complaints, issues and concerns should first be directed to me
in an effort to resolve them amicably and promptly. FCC s2250.
