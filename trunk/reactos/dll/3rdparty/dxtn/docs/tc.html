    <hr/>

    <p><a href="tc-1.1.tar.gz">tc-1.1.tar.gz</a> is a working codec for <b>FXT1</b> and <b>DXTn</b> texture compression.
    It has a balanced speed/quality ratio, and is very tweakable.</p>
    <p>Both <b>FXT1</b> and <b>DXTn</b> use vector quantization for lossy encoding.
    The decoder is rather trivial, at the expense of the encoder
    complexity. This means that applications heavily relying on
    texture compression should provide precompressed textures, for
    several obvious reasons:</p>
    <ol>
	<li>the encoding phase can be done "off-line" with hi-quality
	    encoders</li>
	<li>if the graphic driver does not support precompressed textures,
	    it's still cheap to decode "on-line" application-side</li>
	<li>the distributed package gets smaller</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The <b>FXT1</b> and <b>DXTn</b> codecs were written using documentation freely
    available on the world-wide-web, including, but not limited to:
    3DFX_texture_compression_FXT1 and EXT_texture_compression_s3tc
    from <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/">http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/</a><BR/>
    I just translated the human readable spec into ANSI C. There are
    NO binaries available, as I am <b>NOT</b> using this code! <b>Therefore,
    <font color="#D8D8D8">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF USING THE CODE IS ENTIRELY WITH YOU!</font></b></p>
    <p>The implementation <I>per-se</I> is made available under GPL, which
    does not necessarily apply to the abstract content (texture
    compression algorithms):</p>
    <p><b>FXT1</b> is subject to "3DFX FXT1 Source Code General Public License"</p>
    <p><b>DXTn</b> is basically the S3TC texture compression, a license to the
     "S3TC Intellectual Property" may be required prior to any use.</p>
    <dir>
	<p>There is significant IP associated with the S3TC format.
	Existing users probably have executed licenses directly
	with S3 or its successors (Sonic Blue, S3 Graphics).</p>

	<p>The current ownership of the S3TC IP is unknown to me. It is
	known that when S3 exited the graphics hardware business, part of
	their operations were sold to ATI and part were spun off to a joint
	Taiwanese venture with Via Technologies, called S3 Graphics.</p>
