ReactOS Audio Service (audiosrv.exe)
====================================

This is intended to operate in a similar manner to how the Windows Audio
Service does.

NOTE: The service filename is audiosrv.dll on Windows XP. This shouldn't
have any impact on functionality.

AudioSrv on Windows creates a mapped file at:
Global\mmGlobalPnpInfo

This file appears to contain a list of devices that WinMM accesses and
subsequently passes to wdmaud.drv

It is not necessary to duplicate the exact structure of this mapped 
file, since it appears to only be used internally by Windows components.

The ROS Audio Service (RosAudioSrv) is intended to be able to run 
alongside the Windows Audio Service on XP/Vista, so it should be 
possible to test in a "known working environment" ;)

It will create a mutex, to:
1) Allow synchronization when accessing the device list
2) Provide a simple method of identifying if RosAudioSrv is running

(It might be worth using an event to notify WinMM when things are 
happening?)

The intention is to make RosAudioSrv receive PnP notifications for 
relevant audio devices, and also let AudioSrv in Windows do this. Then 
it should be possible to create a small application that imitates 
WinMM's actions :)

So far, it doesn't do much... Watch this space!
