1.07 (20071219)
=======================
* Added support for GNU multi-precision libraries. LibGMP and LibMPFR are required for compiling ReactOS Calc with big number support.
* When calculating the standard deviation, the population can be 'n' or 'n-1' as the true Microsoft Calculator does.
* Unified language support: just one executable for all.
* Fixed type bug into CopyMemToClipboard() when compiled with WideChar support.
* The code for handling the memory functions has been simplified and now it calls directly the RPN engine.
* Fixed bug into statistical window, when uploading numbers with different bases.
* Fixed bug into integer limitation: now if the selection changes on QWORD, DWORD, WORD or BYTE, then the result is modified immediately.
* Fixed bug signaled by remi-aldo about a the precision issue.
* Fixed bug into shortcuts from keyboard: modulo shortcut was missing.
* Implemented coloured buttons.
* ReactOS Calc has been compiled for working with x86-64 (still untested on the real hardware).

1.06 (20070518)
=======================
* The decimal separator is copied into the clipboard, but only if it has been typed by the user.
* Now the [+/-] button can change the sign of any number into the output display.
* Added italian translation of the help file.

1.05 (20070503)
=======================
* Fixed bug when the following input keys are pressed: [0] [.] [+/-] and another number, then the dot and the sign were lost.
* The ERROR message at division by zero is displayed again.
* [Exp] button won't work if the output display is zero (0e+100 is always zero).
* Now [.] can start a number directly: if it is pressed when display is empty then "0." is pushed automatically.

1.04 (20070430)
=======================
* Fixed a bug when zero is the first number entered.
* The change of the sign +/- doesn't work if the display is empty or zero.
* Added logical operators into decimal mode (obviously, only the integer part is processed).
* Fixed decimal precision to highest possible resolution.
* Decimal point and thousand separator are now regional dependant.
* Added memory subtraction and memory swap commands.
* Added 2*PI constant (generated by "inv"+"pi").
* Added Help popups for calculator functions.
* Added User's manual and Help file support.
* Now the PASTE menu command is disabled if the clipboard doesn't store good data.
* Fixed bug with BACK button.
* Fixed ":q" command from clipboard to the 'cancel' button.

1.03 (20070404)
=======================
* Added double-click check on statistic window.
* Fixed focus selection when switching from statistic window with RET button.
* EQUAL button will now reduce a number entered with exponential notation (if it's possible).
* Version number was not updated to 1.02 in previous version.

1.02 (20070402)
=======================
* Fixed a "copy-paste" error into hyperbolic functions.
* Now context menu is enabled only when child controls are clicked.

1.01 (20070331)
=======================
* Fixed english translation for "Radians" and "Gradians".
* Corrected conversion between radians and gradians angles.
* Added work-around for catching keys without the keyboard hook (selectable at compile time).
* The version number of the programme has been moved from the resource files to ABOUT.C.
* "DOT" function can be used for starting a number (integer part will be zero).
* Added repeat function.
* If the number is grater than maximum resolution, it will be displayed with exponential notation.
* Removed mouse and keyboard focuses from displayed buttons. 
* Added normal and small icons.
