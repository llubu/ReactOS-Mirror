* Introduction

These are the sources for the ReactOS kernel, system libraries and
applications. ReactOS is the beginnings of a free clone of Windows NT
(aiming at version 4 right now). ReactOS isn't usuable for anything but 
further development, please don't uninstall your existing OSs just yet. 

* Compilation

ReactOS currently only compiles using the djgpp compiler for DOS (or a djgpp
cross compiler with some fiddling). This will change in the near future to
using the mingw32 compiler. It also needs the NASM assembler installed. 
To compile 

1) copy libgcc.a from the djgpp distribution to the ntoskrnl directory
2) make

* Installation

By default ReactOS tries to execute 'c:\reactos\system\shell.bin' on
startup, if you want to see a user program running, copy either
'apps\hello\hello.bin' or 'apps\shell\shell.bin' to 
'c:\reactos\system\shell.bin'. 'hello.bin' will write 'hello world' to the
console, 'shell.bin' will allow you to enter simple commands including
'dir', 'cd' and to execute additional processes e.g. 'hello.bin'.

* Running

Type 'boot.bat' from this directory. ReactOS won't start if a DPMI or VCPI
program is running e.g. Windows or EMM386.
