  \brief IOCTL code: set kernel buffer size.

  This IOCTL is used to set a new size of the circular buffer associated with an instance of NPF.
  When a BIOCSETBUFFERSIZE command is received, the driver frees the old buffer, allocates the new one 
  and resets all the parameters associated with the buffer in the OPEN_INSTANCE structure. The currently 
  buffered packets are lost.

/*!
  \brief IOCTL code: set packet filtering program.

  This IOCTL sets a new packet filter in the driver. Before allocating any memory for the new filter, the 
  bpf_validate() function is called to check the correctness of the filter. If this function returns TRUE, 
  the filter is copied to the driver's memory, its address is stored in the bpfprogram field of the 
  OPEN_INSTANCE structure associated with current instance of the driver, and the filter will be applied to 
  every incoming packet. This command also empties the circular buffer used by current instance 
  to store packets. This is done to avoid the presence in the buffer of packets that do not match the filter.
