 * Clock handling routines.
 *
 * This code is written to operate with two timers that run independently of
 * each other.  The main clock, running hz times per second, is used to keep
 * track of real time.  The second timer handles kernel and user profiling,
 * and does resource use estimation.  If the second timer is programmable,
 * it is randomized to avoid aliasing between the two clocks.  For example,
 * the randomization prevents an adversary from always giving up the cpu
 * just before its quantum expires.  Otherwise, it would never accumulate
 * cpu ticks.  The mean frequency of the second timer is stathz.
 *
 * If no second timer exists, stathz will be zero; in this case we drive
 * profiling and statistics off the main clock.  This WILL NOT be accurate;
 * do not do it unless absolutely necessary.
 *
 * The statistics clock may (or may not) be run at a higher rate while
 * profiling.  This profile clock runs at profhz.  We require that profhz
 * be an integral multiple of stathz.
 *
 * If the statistics clock is running fast, it must be divided by the ratio
 * profhz/stathz for statistics.  (For profiling, every tick counts.)
