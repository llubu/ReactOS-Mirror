Some notes on debugging the ReactOS kernel
------------------------------------------

* Interpreting crashes

If the kernel causes a fatal cpu fault then it will print out a message and
halt. This message contains important information for debugging the problem,
look for these lines

Exception: xx(yy)
CS:EIP 20:zzzzzzzzzzzz

Here xx is the type of error, usually either 14 or 13 and yy is the error
code. Generally error codes 13 and 14 both mean the kernel tried to access
some memory in an invalid way. zzzzzzzzz is the address of the erronous
instruction.
