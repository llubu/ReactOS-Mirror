# ReactOS WINE porting guide for 0.2
# Update this file when you port a dll/program from WINE.

The ReactOS Project shares quite a bit of code with the WINE project.
This document should provide a compleate reference for all of the
locations in the ReactOS source tree where code is shared between the
two projects. If you find something is missing from this documentation
please add it.

If you find that a function in ReactOS that is not implemented properly
and is based on WINE sources, check the latest Winehq CVS and see if
it has been fixed there. If so, please submit a patch to 
ros-kernel@reactos.com. Otherwise please send a patch to both 
wine-patches@winehq.com and ros-kernel@reactos.com

When porting a dll from WINE to ReactOS please take a look at how
comctl32 has been imported. We start by creating a makefile that has
a target defined like so:

TARGET_TYPE = winedll

This will cause the reactos build system to look for a file called
makefile.ros-template. This file contains all of the information needed
for the ReactOS build system to make use of the WINE Makefile.in. 
This will allow you to use the WINE tools and librarys with very little
work to import a new dll.

The following build tools are derived from Wine.
reactos/tools/wmc		# Wine Message Compiler
reactos/tools/winebuild		# Wine Build tool for Creating *.def files
reactos/tools/bin2res		# Resource to binary converter

The following shared libraries are a 100% port from Winehq sourcs.

ReactOS shares the following programs with Winehq.
reactos/subsys/system/regedit	#Out of sync
reactos/subsys/system/expand

In addition the following source files are mostly based on code ported
from Winehq CVS. If you are looking to update something in these files
check Wine current souces first as it may already be fixed.
