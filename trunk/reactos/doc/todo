* Critical path tasks
       	Test and debug Registry routines
	Implement file cache
	Implement paging

* These tasks would be nice
       Separate HAL into KM DLL

* Function groups totally or partially unimplemented

       Dma functions (see hal/x86/dma.c)
       PCI interface functions (see hal/x86/bios32.c, hal/x86/pci.c)
       HalExamineMbr
       Locale support (see ex/locale.c)
       Shutdown support (see ex/power.c)
       Zw(Set/Get)SystemInformation (see ex/sysinfo.c)
       Adapter functions (see io/adapter.c)
       Io cancelation support (see io/cancel, et al)
       Directory change notification (see io/dir.c)
       Error logging (see io/errlog.c)
       Buffer flushing (see io/flush.c)
       Io completion ports (see io/iocomp.c)
       File locking (see io/lock.c)
       Mailslots (see io/mailslot.c)
       Named pipes (see io/npipe.c)
       Hardware resource management (see io/resource.c)

       Exception support (see ke/catch.c)
       Mutex support (see ke/mutex.c)
       Semaphore support (see ke/sem.c)
       Timer support (see ke/timer.c)
       Single linked lists (see rtl/slist.c)
       Sequenced lists (see rtl/seqlist.c)
       
* Verify implementation

       Fast mutexes (see ex/fmutex.c)
       
* Major areas

       Security support (see se/*.c)
       SCSI miniport driver
       
* Drivers
       NTFS, EXT2 filesystems
       Many others (use oem's where possible)
       
* For the future
       DOS, Win16, POSIX subsystems
