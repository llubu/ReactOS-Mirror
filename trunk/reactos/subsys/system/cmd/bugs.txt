Known bugs in CMD version 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o  let set work with or without the '=' sign.  People like it that way.
    (I don't know, if I should really fix this?)

o  command.com ignores control-c and control-break, which makes it difficult
   to quit typing a long file, among other things

o  "alias v = dir" doesn't work because of the spaces.

o  Dymatic commandline buffer need to be implement, current set to 8192bytes  

o  Batchfile read row size need to be implement as dymatic not set to 2000bytes
