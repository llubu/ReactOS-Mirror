1. What is ReactOS?

   ReactOS is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system
that is compatible with Windows NT applications and drivers.

   The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows NT 4.0
compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with
future Windows NT releases, that is, Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) and
Windows XP (NT 5.1).

More information is available at http://www.reactos.org/.
