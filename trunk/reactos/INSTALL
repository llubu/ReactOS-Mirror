1. Build environment

To build the system you need either mingw32 installed on Windows or a
mingw32 cross compiler running on unix.

2. Building

To build from Windows run 'make -fmakefile.dos'. To build from unix, edit
rules.mak and change the PREFIX variable to the correct value for your
cross-compiler, then run 'make'.

3. Installation

Installation isn't yet automated, sorry. The system can only be installed on
the first partition which must be formatted for DOS. Set up a directory
structure like the following

make directories C:\reactos,C:\reactos\system,C:\reactos\system\drivers

Copy apps/shell/shell.exe to C:\reactos\system
Copy services/dd/keyboard/keyboard.sys to C:\reactos\system\drivers
Copy services/dd/blue/blue.sys to C:\reactos\system\drivers

The system can only be started from DOS. Copy the following files,
services/dd/ide/ide.sys, services/fs/vfat/vfatfsd.sys and
loaders/dos/loadros.com, to a suitable directory. The system can then be
booted with the command 'loadros.com ide.sys vfatfsd.sys'.
