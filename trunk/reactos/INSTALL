1. Build environment

To build the system you need either mingw32 installed on Windows or a mingw32
cross compiler running on unix. You may obtain MinGW binaries that build
ReactOS from http://www.reactos.com. 


2. Building ReactOS

To build from Windows run 'make' (wihout the quotes) from the top directory.
To build from unix, edit rules.mak and change the PREFIX variable to the
correct value for your cross-compiler. Run 'export HOST=mingw32-linux' to
tell the ReactOS build system that it is building ReactOS on a linux machine.
Now run 'make'.


3. Installation

The system can only be installed on the first partition on the first harddisk.
The partition must be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. The system can only be
started from DOS and not from a Windows DOS-prompt.

ReactOS can be installed from the source distribution or from the binary
distribution. The two ways to install ReactOS are explained below.


3.1 Installation from sources

To install ReactOS after building it, type 'make install'. This will create
the directory 'reactos' in the top directory. Copy this directory to the root
of your first partition on your first harddisk. This is usually c:\ on a
Windows machine.

If you don't want to copy the files manually every time you run a 'make install',
you can specify the directory where the files are to be copied to during
installation.

In rules.mak find the variable INSTALL_DIR and change the assigned value to the
name of the directory where the files are to be copied to. If you are using
Windows this could be:

    INSTALL_DIR = c:\reactos

If you are on linux this could be:

    INSTALL_DIR = /mnt/windows/reactos

Save the changes to rules.mak and run 'make install' to install the files to
the new location. If you don't want to change rules.mak, you can specify the
installtion directory when invoking make. Run
'make INSTALL_DIR=c:\reactos install' to install to c:\reactos.


3.2 Installation from binany distribution

To install ReactOS from the binary distribution, extract the archive contents
to c:\reactos. Remember to extract the files with full paths.


4. Booting ReactOS

Startup in DOS mode. 'cd' to c:\reactos and type 'boot' and press <enter>.
A simple shell is started where you can use simple commands like 'cd' and 'dir'.
